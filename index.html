business public liability insurance
It takes long hours and extensive planning to safeguard your business’ growth and success, and you don’t want to be left blindsided by the unexpected. For this reason, public liability insurance* can be one of the most important considerations when starting up or maintaining a business.

What is public liability insurance?
Public liability insurance is designed to protect you and your business should a customer, supplier or member of the public bring a claim against you for injuries or property damage caused by your negligent business activities.

As a business owner, you have a duty of care to any third party that comes into contact with your business and its activities. Businesses open to the public can be especially vulnerable to third party accidents, which can result in costly public liability claims.

Having an adequate level of cover for your business can help you avoid potentially crippling litigation fees and continue your day-to-day operations.

What public liability insurance typically covers
Public liability insurance usually covers:

Any loss or damage your businesses causes to third party property
Your legal liability for the personal injury or death of a third party
Any compensation you’re ordered to pay as a result of a covered claim
Legal costs incurred in defending a covered claim
Your business type and size directly affect the level of public liability insurance you may require. For example, a rock climbing business holds an inherent risk of injury to clients, so these business owners would typically need greater public liability coverage and will likely pay a higher premium as a result.

Conversely, a florist may face a smaller risk and therefore only require a lower level of coverage. While it’s not a legal obligation in Australia, it’s strongly recommended all businesses consider public liability insurance.

What it doesn’t cover
Before taking out public liability insurance, it’s crucial to understand what isn’t included in your coverage. The policy wording in your Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) will tell you what’s excluded by your policy. However, typical exclusions include:

Your responsibility for your injured workers. This is covered through workers’ compensation insurance.
Punitive damages. The extra damages awarded if a judge believes your behaviour was exceedingly reprehensible.
Product recalls and withdrawals. Expenses that arise when your business’ products are recalled from the market.
Asbestos. This includes incidents involving asbestos materials. This is typically covered under asbestos liability insurance.
Aircraft products. They are usually covered under different levels of aviation insurance.
Whether you’re operating your business in QLD, NSW or any other state within Australia, you should check for any state-specific public liability requirements with your insurer.

Why might I need public liability insurance?
From a customer’s slip and fall to accidentally knocking your coffee over a client’s laptop, accidents can happen – and they can cost your business significantly in legal action. Although it’s an added expense, public liability coverage is one bill that may save your business operations from grinding to a halt.
How much does public liability insurance cost?
How much you pay for your public liability insurance will depend on:

The size of your business – the bigger your company, the more you’re likely to pay.
What type of business you run – manual labourers generally pay more than desk workers, because there’s a higher risk of damage and injury.
Your health and safety record – careful businesses may find their quotes are much cheaper.
Your claims history – you may have to pay more if you’ve made claims in the past.
